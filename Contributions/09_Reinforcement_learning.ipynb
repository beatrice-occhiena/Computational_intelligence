    "### Key concepts\n",
    "- **Agent and Environment Interaction**: an agent performs actions that modify the environment and, in return, receives a reward for each action. The state of the environment and the reward are updated with each step creating the following cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The agent:\n",
    "    1. Receive an `observation` $S^A_t$ from the environment\n",
    "    2. Select an `action` $A_t$ based on the observation\n",
    "    3. Execute the action $A_t$ and receive a reward $R_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The environment:\n",
    "    1. Receive an action $A_t$ from the agent\n",
    "    2. Execute the action $A_t$ and update its `state` to $S^E_{t+1}$\n",
    "    3. Calculate the `reward` $R_{t}$ and send it to the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment State and Observability**: the state of the environment is a representation of the current situation of the environment. It is a function of the `history` of all the previous actions and observations. The agent does not have direct access to the state of the environment, but only to the observation $S^A_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  An environment is **fully observable** if the agent can directly observe all aspects of the environment ($S^A_t = S^E_t$).\n",
