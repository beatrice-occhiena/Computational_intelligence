    "- **Individual**: a single candidate solution to the problem\n",
    "- **Population**: a set of individuals\n",
    "- **Generation**: the population at a given iteration of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genotype**: the structured/coded representation of an individual which can be manipulated by the algorithm during breeding (e.g. a string of bits, a vector of real numbers, a tree, ...) - ⚠️ it is not directly interpretable as the final solution and may not resemble the problem domain\n",
    "  - **Gene**: a single element of the genotype\n",
    "- **Phenotype**: the actual decoded solution to the problem used to evaluate the fitness of the individual - ⚠️ it is not directly manipulable by the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evolution\n",
    "- **Breeding**: the process of creating new individuals from existing ones\n",
    "  - **Mutation**: a random change in the individual due to plain tweaking - `asexual breeding`\n",
    "  - **Crossover**: a combination of two individuals' genes to create one or more new individuals - `sexual breeding`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Selection\n",
    "- **Fitness**: a measure of how good an individual is\n",
    "  - **Fitness landscape**: a graphical representation of the fitness of all possible individuals\n",
    "  - **Evaluation**: the process of assigning a fitness value to an individual - NB: it can be computationally expensive especially if requires to launch a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection**: the process of choosing which individuals will be parents for the next generation\n",
    "  - **Selection pressure**: the degree to which better individuals are more likely to be selected\n",
    "    - **Elitism**: the best individuals are always selected\n",
    "    - **Tournament**: a random subset of individuals is selected and the best one is chosen\n",
    "    - **Roulette**: each individual is selected with a probability proportional to its fitness"

The population is updated at each iteration (generation) of the algorithm. The population is the main data structure of the algorithm.\n",
