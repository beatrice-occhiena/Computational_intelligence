    "# Logical Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents that:\n",
    "1. Store some `representation of complex knowledge` about the world and its environment.\n",
    "2. Have an `inference mechanism` to derive new information combining pre-existing knowledge with new perceptions.\n",
    "3. Use the derived information to `make good decisions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Knowledge Representation\n",
    "**OB:** üë®üèª Human knowledge **-translated->** üíª Computer-translatable form\n",
    "- Knowledge Representation **Language**:\n",
    "  - `Syntax`: define the set of all possible sentences that can be expressed in the language using its symbols.\n",
    "  - `Semantics`: define the truth-value of a sentence.\n",
    "- **Sentence**: a statement about the world that can be true or false.\n",
    "- **Model** of a sentence: a possible world in which the sentence is true.\n",
    "  - $M(s)$: the set of all models where $s$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Reasoning\n",
    "**OB:** Premises **-inference-rules->** Conclusions\n",
    "- `Deductive reasoning`: conclusions are entailed by the premises.\n",
    "- `Inductive reasoning`: conclusions are supported by the premises.\n",
    "- `Abductive reasoning`: conclusions are the best explanation for the premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entailment (‚ä®)** guarantees that the conclusion is true if the premises are true.\n",
    "  - $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n \\models s$ means that $s$ is true in all models where $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$ are true.\n",
    "  - $M(s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n) \\subseteq M(s)$\n",

    "### Propositional Logic (PL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Propositional Logic (PL) is a formal language for representing knowledge about the world in terms of atomic sentences and logical connectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Propositional Symbols**: atomic sentences that can be true or false.\n",

    "- **Connectives**: operators that combine sentences into more complex sentences.\n",
    "  - $\\neg, \\land, \\lor, \\implies, \\iff$\n",
    "- **Truth Tables**: define the truth-value of a sentence given the truth-value of its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First-Order Logic (FOL)\n",
    "\n",
    "First-Order Logic (FOL), also known as Predicate Logic, extends propositional logic by introducing new elements, allowing for more expressive statements about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objects**: genreal entities in the world with individual identities.\n",
    "    - Can be concrete (e.g. people, cars, etc.) or abstract (e.g. numbers, sets, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Properties**: characteristics of objects.\n",
    "    - Can be intrinsic (e.g. color, size, etc.) or relational (e.g. tall, heavy, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relations**: properties that hold between objects.\n",
    "    - Can be binary (e.g. father of, bigger than, etc.) or n-ary (e.g. between, etc.).\n",
    "    - `Functions`: subset of relations that map each object to exactly one object (e.g. father of, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quantifiers**:\n",
    "   - **Universal Quantifier (‚àÄ)**: Indicates that a statement holds for all objects in the domain.\n",
    "   - **Existential Quantifier (‚àÉ)**: Indicates that a statement holds for at least one object in the domain.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Fuzzy Logic (FL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Logic (FL) is a formal language for representing knowledge about the world in terms of atomic sentences and logical connectives, *where the truth-value of a sentence is a real number in the interval [0, 1].*\n",
    "\n",
    "Introdued in 1965 by Lotfi Zadeh, FL is based on the concept of *fuzzy set*, which is a set whose elements have varying degrees of membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**OB:** It allows for reasoning with `uncertain or imprecise information` by assigning degrees of truth to propositions rather than strictly binary true or false values.\n",
    "- More nuanced decision-making in situations where traditional binary logic may not adequately capture the complexity of real-world conditions."
