    "# Lab 2: Nim game\n",
    "\n",
    "The game of Nim is a well-known **combinatorial misÃ¨re game** in which we have a number of objects (say coins ðŸª™ in this case) arranged in different rows. In each turn, a player can remove one or more objects from a single row and the player who takes the last object loses. The game is usually played with a number of rows and a maximum number of objects that can be removed in a turn. \n",

    "* Create the directory `lab2` inside your personal course repository for the course \n",
