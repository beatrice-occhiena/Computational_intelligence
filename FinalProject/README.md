# Final Project: Quixo Player

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a player for the game Quixo, a board game invented by Thierry Chapeau and published by Gigamic in 1991.

### Game description
Quixo is played on a 5x5 board. Each square of the board initially contains a neutral piece, represented by -1 in the code. The game is played by two players:
- Player 0: ❌
- Player 1: 🔘

#### Rules
Players take turns to play. A turn consists of two actions: 
1. Taking a piece from the board.
2. Then sliding it back onto the board.

A piece can only be taken from the edge of the board if it is either neutral or already belongs to that player. Once a piece is taken, the player marks it as their own.

The player then slides the piece back onto the board from a different edge, pushing the other pieces to make room.
> The direction in which a piece can be slid back onto the board depends on its position. Pieces not in a corner can be moved in directions parallel to the edge they were taken from. Corner pieces have more restricted movement options.

#### Winning condition
A player wins by forming a continuous line of five of their pieces, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game checks for a winner after each turn. If a player has formed such a line, they are declared the winner.

The game continues with players alternating turns until one player wins or the board is in a state where no further moves can lead to a win (though this condition is not explicitly checked in the original `class Game` code).
